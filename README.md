# Spirograph
Program that draws a Spirograph using python turtle graphics.

This program prompts the user for the number of "arms" and then the lengths and angular velocities of each arm.
The spirograph is drawn by laying each arm end to end, like in vector addition, and a point is placed at the end of the last one.

Modes 2 and 3 (in other branches) will draw spirographs using other methods.

For the best looking results, it is recommended to set the angular velocities to small (less than 1) values. These angular velocities have no units at the moment, as the system just adds them as fast as possible on each iteration of the main loop.
