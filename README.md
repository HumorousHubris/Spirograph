# Spirograph
Program that draws a Spirograph using python turtle graphics.

This mode uses two spinning points, and at each step a line is drawn between them.

Best values to use are angular velocities from 1-10.
Using pi yeilded interesting results.

Some configurations lead to shapes that are too complex for this resolution, and will eventually result in a solid circle of color.
